Pushing your code to mainstream or to your adva clone
=====================================================

  Here is quick way to push your code up: 
    cd vendor/adva
    open .git/config
    change: url = git://github.com/svenfuchs/adva_cms.git
    to your adva clone: url = git@github.com:MY_GITHUB_USERNAME/adva_cms.git
    or to mainstream: url = git@github.com:svenfuchs/adva_cms.git
    
    then pushing up to the new location:
    git push origin master


Git workflow to avoid merges
============================

  Usually git merges are not good indicator, often it means master branch is abused :-)

  Here is priit's workflow, what he thinks is the correct way of using git:

    master$ git pull master
    # NEVER to any changes at master, get habit to make branches on the
    fly however small task you have (you NEVER know if someone has pushed
    something to master meantime etc)

    master$ git checkout newsletter

    newsletter$ git rebase master
    # rebase is important to update your branch with master, don't use
    # merge (it pollute to much log file)

    # coding...
    # when I'm done with my feature

    newsletter$ git add ...your files
    newsletter$ git commit ...your files

    newsletter$ git chechkout master
    master$ git pull # so I can update to master and see what's new

    master$ git checkout newsletter
    newsletter$ git rebase master

    # NOW i run tests, if everything is ok then I merge (now git makes it fast forward way)
    newsletter$ git checkout master
    master$ git merge newsletter
    master$ git push origin master

  I hope it helps for everyone use git.
