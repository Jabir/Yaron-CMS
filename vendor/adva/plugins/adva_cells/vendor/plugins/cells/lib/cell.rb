module Cell
  # == Basic overview
  #
  # A Cell is the central notion of the cells plugin.  A cell acts as a
  # lightweight controller in the sense that it will assign variables and
  # render a view.  Cells can be rendered from other cells as well as from
  # regular controllers and views (see ActionView::Base#render_cell and
  # ControllerMethods#render_cell_to_string)
  #
  # == A render_cell() cycle
  #
  # A typical <tt>render_cell</tt> state rendering cycle looks like this:
  #   render_cell :blog, :newest_article, {...}
  # - an instance of the class <tt>BlogCell</tt> is created, and a hash containing
  #   arbitrary parameters is passed
  # - the <em>state method</em> <tt>newest_article</tt> is executed and assigns instance
  #   variables to be used in the view
  # - if the method returns a string, the cycle ends, rendering the string
  # - otherwise, the corresponding <em>state view</em> is searched.
  #   Usually the cell will first look for a view template in
  #   <tt>app/cells/blog/newest_article.html. [erb|haml|...]</tt>
  # - after the view has been found, it is rendered and returned
  #
  # It is common to simply return <tt>nil</tt> in state methods to advice the cell to
  # render the corresponding template.
  #
  # == Design Principles
  # A cell is a completely autonomous object and it should not know or have to know
  # from what controller it is being rendered.  For this reason, the controller's
  # instance variables and params hash are not directly available from the cell or
  # its views. This is not a bug, this is a feature!  It means cells are truly
  # reusable components which can be plugged in at any point in your application
  # without having to think about what information is available at that point.
  # When rendering a cell, you can explicitly pass variables to the cell in the
  # extra opts argument hash, just like you would pass locals in partials.
  # This hash is then available inside the cell as the @opts instance variable.
  #
  # == Directory hierarchy
  #
  # To get started creating your own cells, you can simply create a new directory
  # structure under your <tt>app</tt> directory called <tt>cells</tt>.  Cells are
  # ruby classes which end in the name Cell.  So for example, if you have a
  # cell which manages all user information, it would be called <tt>UserCell</tt>.
  # A cell which manages a shopping cart could be called <tt>ShoppingCartCell</tt>.
  #
  # The directory structure of this example would look like this:
  #   app/
  #     models/
  #       ..
  #     views/
  #       ..
  #     helpers/
  #       application_helper.rb
  #       product_helper.rb
  #       ..
  #     controllers/
  #       ..
  #     cells/
  #       shopping_cart_cell.rb
  #       shopping_cart/
  #         status.html.erb
  #         product_list.html.erb
  #         empty_prompt.html.erb
  #       user_cell.rb
  #       user/
  #         login.html.erb
  #     ..
  #
  # The directory with the same name as the cell contains views for the
  # cell's <em>states</em>.  A state is an executed method along with a
  # rendered view, resulting in content. This means that states are to
  # cells as actions are to controllers, so each state has its own view.
  # The use of partials is deprecated with cells, it is better to just
  # render a different state on the same cell (which also works recursively).
  #
  # Anyway, <tt>render :partial </tt> in a cell view will work, if the
  # partial is contained in the cell's view directory.
  #
  # As can be seen above, Cells also can make use of helpers.  All Cells
  # include ApplicationHelper by default, but you can add additional helpers
  # as well with the Cell::Base.helper class method:
  #   class ShoppingCartCell < Cell::Base
  #     helper :product
  #     ...
  #   end
  #
  # This will make the <tt>ProductHelper</tt> from <tt>app/helpers/product_helper.rb</tt>
  # available from all state views from our <tt>ShoppingCartCell</tt>.
  #
  # == Cell inheritance
  #
  # Unlike controllers, Cells can form a class hierarchy.  When a cell class
  # is inherited by another cell class, its states are inherited as regular
  # methods are, but also its views are inherited.  Whenever a view is looked up,
  # the view finder first looks for a file in the directory belonging to the
  # current cell class, but if this is not found in the application or any
  # engine, the superclass' directory is checked.  This continues all the
  # way up until it stops at Cell::Base.
  #
  # For instance, when you have two cells:
  #   class MenuCell < Cell::Base
  #     def show
  #     end
  #
  #     def edit
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   class MainMenuCell < MenuCell
  #     .. # no need to redefine show/edit if they do the same!
  #   end
  # and the following directory structure in <tt>app/cells</tt>:
  #   app/cells/
  #     menu/
  #       show.html.erb
  #       edit.html.erb
  #     main_menu/
  #       show.html.erb
  # then when you call
  #   render_cell :main_menu, :show
  # the main menu specific show.html.erb (<tt>app/cells/main_menu/show.html.erb</tt>)
  # is rendered, but when you call
  #   render_cell :main_menu, :edit
  # cells notices that the main menu does not have a specific view for the
  # <tt>edit</tt> state, so it will render the view for the parent class,
  # <tt>app/cells/menu/edit.html.erb</tt>
  #
  #
  # == Gettext support
  #
  # Cells support gettext, just name your views accordingly. It works exactly equivalent
  # to controller views.
  #
  #   cells/user/user_form.html.erb
  #   cells/user/user_form_de.html.erb
  #
  # If gettext is set to DE_de, the latter view will be chosen.
