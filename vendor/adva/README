Welcome to adva-cms
===================
 
adva-cms is a cutting edge open source application platform based on Ruby on
Rails and Rails Engines.

Different from others, adva-cms lives in vendor directory and keeps your main
app directory clean and dandy. So you can reclaim app directory and use it
only for your own application files.

adva-cms makes it extensible: you can only pick those engines/features you really
need for your application and omit the rest. All engines are designed to work
together seamlessly, so the whole platform feels much more consistent for
similar but separate Rails applications.
 
Please check out /doc directory and our site http://adva-cms.org for more info.

Required: Rails 2.3.2.1 or newer, ImageMagick for image handling

  rails my-app
  cd my-app
  rm public/index.html

# Prepare the config/environment.rb and remove the public/index.html

	require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'boot')
	require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '../vendor/adva/engines/adva_cms/boot') # this line

# Clone the adva-cms ( this might take a bit, grab a coffee meanwhile :) )
  git clone git://github.com/svenfuchs/adva_cms.git vendor/adva  # or use: git submodule add ...

# Install the core engines and copy the assets
  rake adva:install:core -R vendor/adva/engines/adva_cms/lib/tasks # install adva-cms to vendor/plugins/
  rake adva:assets:install                                         # symlinks plugin assets to public/

# Start the server

Installing/Uninstalling adva-cms engines and plugins
====================================================

You can install/uninstall adva-cms engines and plugins by using a set of rake
tasks. Installation simply works by symlinking (copying on Windows) to 
vendor/plugins.

There are the following tasks/subtasks:

	rake adva:install:all
	rake adva:install:core
	rake adva:install

	rake adva:uninstall:all
	rake adva:uninstall:core
	rake adva:uninstall

For each of these tasks you can specify the option except and give it a list
of engine/plugin names that should be excluded from the install/ uninstall
task. E.g.

	rake adva:install:all except=adva_themes,adva_wiki
	rake adva:uninstall:all except=adva_themes,adva_wiki

For the tasks adva:install and adva:uninstall one can specify the options
engines and plugins and give it a list of engine/plugin names that should be
included to the task. E.g.

	rake adva:install engines=adva_themes,adva_wiki plugins=adva_url_history
	rake adva:uninstall engines=adva_themes,adva_wiki plugins=adva_url_history

(Accidentally, for the task adva:install:core one can specify the plugins
option in the same way and thus install all core engines plus certain
plugins.)

For both the engines and plugins options one can specify the keyword "all"
which then expands to all available engines and plugins respectively. Thus,
these are equivalent:

	rake adva:install:all
	rake adva:install engines=all plugins=all
	
When the "all" keyword is used with the uninstall task this only applies to 
all engines and plugins except the adva-cms core engines. To uninstall these
you can still simply delete the symlinks (directories on Windows) from 
vendor/plugins.

NOTE please note that right now assets not installed to public/ when engines are
installed and they are not removed from public/ when engines are uninstalled.
So after you've installed additional engines you'll most probably want to 
install the assets to public:

	rake adva:assets:install


Configuration
=============
 
You can change adva-cms configuration by including an initializer to your 
application and overwriting things that adva-cms sets as defaults. See the 
initializers in adva-cms engines/plugins, e.g. in

	vendor/plugins/adva_cms/config/initializers/*


Running tests
=============

Running tests for adva-cms version 0.1.2 or newer:

  rake db:test:clone       										# Clones from your development database to test database
	vendor/adva/script/test vendor/adva/engines # Runs all tests if you do not have a script file
  ruby script/test-adva-cms -p 								# Prepares the database and runs all adva-cms tests
  ruby script/test-adva-cms    								# Runs all adva-cms tests without preparing the database
  ruby script/test-adva-cms vendor/plugins/adva_wiki # Runs only adva_wiki tests
  WEBRAT_MODE=selenium ruby script/test-adva-cms     # Runs integration tests in automated browser mode (see Installing Selenium section)

Please check out /doc directory for high level overview about adva-cms.


Installing Selenium
===================

$ (sudo) gem install Selenium selenium-client


Unfortunately the jar that the Selenium gem (version 1.1.14) comes with does not work with Firefox 3. So we have to get the latest jar from the Selenium-RC site:

Download the Selenium RC Beta 2:

http://seleniumhq.org/download/

Once you have extracted the download we copy:

selenium-remote-control-1.0-beta-2/selenium-server-1.0-beta-2/selenium-server.jar

Over the jar that was installed with the Selenium gem:

GEM_INSTALL_DIR/Selenium-1.1.14/lib/selenium/openqa/selenium-server.jar.txt # yes, with .txt in the end
