# Sections refactoring

Sections are now Contents and Contents are nested sets.

Introduce a new Section type Page, which basically does the same thing as the
current Section does but adds the ability to configure a single- or 
multi-article mode. 


# Documents refactoring

We have:

Assets       - belong to a Site, can be attached to Contents, have a Paperclip file, don't have a title
Photos       - belong to an Album, can not be attached to others, have a Paperclip file, have a title
Documents    - belong to a ?, can be attached to anything, have a Paperclip file, have a title (name)
Theme::Files - belong to a Theme, can not be attached to others, have a Paperclip file, don't have a title

Obviously we should refactor these to use a single, or maybe two common base classes.

* add roles interface
* remove observers and make behaviour more explicit by using events/listeners?
  e.g. page caching
* redesign/abstract adva_activity
* redesign rbac to work with arbitrary group memberships
