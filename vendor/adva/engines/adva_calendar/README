The calendar engine models:
* Calendar which is a section
* Event
* Category
* Location
* Bookmark (A User-Event relation)

A calendar has many categories
A calendar has many events
An event takes place at a location
A bookmark belongs to a single event and user


Event:
Has a start and end datetime
Has a title, description, keywords and host
Repeating events are copied and stored for every occurrence with reference to first event
Longterm events (like an exhibition with opening hours) are stored once and should use description field for opening hours.
